I am a long-term visiting student at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in/) working in condensed matter theory. In June this year, I got my M.Sc. in Physics from the [IIT Bombay](https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/). Before that, I was an undergraduate in Physics at [Hansraj College](https://www.hansrajcollege.ac.in/), University of Delhi.

If you are currently a school student or an undergraduate in one of the state or central universities of India like I once was and want to be a physicist, chances are there are some important things you currently don't know about. The purpose of this website is to provide more exposure to people like you about a career in science.
