I am a long-term visiting student at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in/) working in condensed matter theory with Prof. [Sumathi Rao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumathi_Rao) and Prof. [Arijit Kundu](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~kundua/). In June this year, I got my M.Sc. in Physics from [IIT Bombay](https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/). Before that, I was an undergraduate in Physics at [Hansraj College](https://www.hansrajcollege.ac.in/), University of Delhi.

If you are currently a school student or an undergraduate in one of the state or central universities of India like I once was and want to be a physicist, chances are there are some important things you currently don't know about. The purpose of this website is to provide more exposure to people like you about a career in science. Please refer to the following PDF for advice regarding introductory physics, how you should self-study, how modern-day research works and how you can utilise time properly during your undergraduate:
