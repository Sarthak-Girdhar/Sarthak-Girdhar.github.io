I am a long-term visiting student at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in/) working in condensed matter theory. Earlier, I got my M.Sc. in Physics from the [IIT Bombay](https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/) in June 2023. Before that, I was an undergraduate in Physics at [Hansraj College](https://www.hansrajcollege.ac.in/), University of Delhi.

If you are currently a school student, or an undergraduate in one of the state or central universities of India and want to build a career in physics, chances are there are some important things that you don't know about.
